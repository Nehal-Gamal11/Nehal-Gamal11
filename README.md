Over the years, I've gained hands-on experience in business analytics through various roles and intensive training programs. My expertise includes Python programming, SQL, and a range of analytical tools, which I honed during my participation in the Digital Egypt Builders Initiative. This eight-month intensive program equipped me with advanced skills in statistical modeling and data science tools.

I've also been actively involved in student activities and completed several impactful internships and workshops, including a financial inclusion summer training program at Commercial International Bank and a web development workshop by instant. These experiences have broadened my perspective and sharpened my skills in both business analysis and web development.

My technical skills encompass a variety of programming languages and tools, including:
